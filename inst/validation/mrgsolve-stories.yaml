  description: See PR 523. Adds two integer members: one indexing the currently

    Two character vectors are kept: (re)names for compartments and (re)names for captures.
    The  calculation of the integer vectors is now done by the update method rather
    than on the fly as the simulation goes. Rather than 'request', we'll update
    `outvars`, listing both compartments and captures. Added initialize method
    to set this up along with some other parts of the model object. Two new functions:
    one to update these new indices; the other to handle updates through `request`
    (working only on the compartment index). Add strict argument to model update
    method; when an option is turned on, the update will generate a warning if the
    user tries to update a non-existent member. Don't allow duplicate names in
    `outvars` and `request`. Output variables in the simulated data will be ordered
    as they are in the model: first, compartments according to compartment number,
    then captures according to capture number. The user can ask for `outvars=(all)`
    to get all compartments and captures in the simulated output. The user
    can ask for `request=(all)` to get all compartments"

  description: "See pull request 519. Since we are no longer using fortran
    code via ODEPACK, we can change to C++11. Using C++11 now with shared
    pointer. There are possibly code in the new ODE solver that requires C++11.
    Best to set this as a System Requirement in addition to setting in Makevars. I
    believe the switch is desired in order to take advantage of more-modern features
    of C++11. Also, I believe the lsoda source code was developed using modern
    compiler and there is some chance that, without the C++11 requirement, some of
    the code may not be compatible with older compilers.  Rather than trying to obtain
    and test on a slew of old compilers I believe it would be better to just modernize
    with C++11. From the Rcpp FAQ: 3.13. Can I use C++11,
    C++14, C++17, . . . with Rcpp. But of course. In a nutshell, this boils down
    to what your compiler supports, and also what R supports. We expanded a little
    on this in Rcpp Gallery article providing more detail. What follows in an
    abridged summary. You can always locally set appropriate PKG_CXXFLAGS as
    an environment variable, or via ~/.R/Makevars. You can also plugins
    and/or R support from src/Makevars: - C++11: has been supported since early
    2013 via a plugin selecting the language standard which is useful for sourceCpp() 
    etc. For packages, R has supported it since R 3.1.0 which added the option
    to select the language standard via CXX_STD = CXX11. As of early 2017, over
    120 packages on CRAN use this. From Writing R Extensions 1.2.4:
    Using C++11 code. As from version 3.6.0, R selects a default C++
    compiler with options that conform as far as possible42 to C++11\r\n\r\n### Kevin

    C++11 If you can use C++11 (or greater) when compiling your package’s C++
    code, just do it. The C++11 standard adds a slew of excellent features, while
    fixing a few omissions of the C++98 standard. Overall, C++11 makes it easier to
    write cross-platform, portable C++ programs. All of the platforms used on CRAN
    support C++11 now – most recently, Windows joined the club with the toolchain
    update spearheaded by Jeroen Ooms et. al, and with much help from Duncan Murdoch
    + others. The only reason not to use C++11 nowadays is if your
    package needs to build on older machines"

    #476 \r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n. refactor `render_time` so that it is more efficient
    and can return `numeric(0)` if there are really no times. We will still simulate
    a minimum time 0 record for each person by only if not doing so would result in
    zero rows in the output"
